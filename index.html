		<h2>What is a cat friend?</h2>
		<p> A cat friend is a friend whom has cat-like tendencies. This person will probably be a little different from the rest
		in a put offish manner, but dont let that get you down! They're not impossible to be friends and while they will be a
		little bit harder to become friends with, it gets easier once you get there and earn your trust. Like all cats everyone
		is different in some way and will have different needs, however there are some base things that are almost unviersal.</p>
